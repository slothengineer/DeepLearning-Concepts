    "Activation function is a function which decides whether neuron should be activated or not by calculating the weighted sum and further adding bias to it. Activation function is used for the introducing non-linearity into the output of the neuron. A neural network without an activation function is essentially just a linear regression model. The activation function does the non-linear transformation to the input making it capable to learn and perform more complex tasks."

    "#### Activation functions play a crucial role in the training process and performance of a neural network. They introduce non-linearity, allowing the network to approximate complex functions. The choice of activation function can significantly impact how the network learns, converges, and generalizes to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-linearity and Representational Power:**\n",
    "   Activation functions introduce non-linearity to the neural network. Without non-linearity, the network would be limited to learning only linear transformations of the input data, severely limiting its expressive power. The non-linear properties of activation functions enable the network to learn and represent more complex relationships between features, improving its ability to handle intricate patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vanishing and Exploding Gradients:**\n",
    "   Activation functions can affect the vanishing or exploding gradients problem during backpropagation, which impacts the training process. Some activation functions, like sigmoid and tanh, saturate at extreme values, leading to gradients close to zero. This makes it challenging for deep networks to learn, as the gradients become too small, and the weights barely update. On the other hand, activation functions like ReLU can cause exploding gradients when used in deep networks without proper initialization or regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training Convergence:**\n",
    "   The choice of activation function can affect the speed of convergence during training. Activation functions like ReLU and its variants (Leaky ReLU, ELU) have been shown to promote faster convergence compared to sigmoid or tanh, as they mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. Faster convergence means the network requires fewer iterations to reach a reasonable solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Avoiding Dead Neurons:**\n",
    "   Some activation functions, like ReLU, can suffer from \"dead neurons\" during training. Dead neurons are neurons that stop learning because they consistently output zero for all inputs. This can happen when the weights are adjusted in such a way that the ReLU always remains inactive (outputting zero). Leaky ReLU and other variants were introduced to address this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Generalization and Overfitting:**\n",
    "   The choice of activation function can influence the generalization ability of the network. Activation functions that add regularization properties, like ELU and SELU, have been proposed to improve generalization. Using the right activation function can help prevent overfitting, which occurs when the network performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Stability and Numerical Issues:**\n",
    "   Some activation functions, like sigmoid and tanh, can suffer from numerical stability issues, particularly when the inputs are large. The exponential nature of these functions can lead to overflow or underflow problems. Activation functions like ReLU and its variants are computationally more efficient and generally do not suffer from such numerical issues.\n",

    "#### The sigmoid activation function, also known as the logistic function, is a type of activation function commonly used in the early days of neural networks. Although it has been largely replaced by more effective activation functions, it is still worth understanding its working principles, advantages, and disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Working:**\n",
    "The sigmoid activation function maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))\n",
    "\n",
    "where 'x' is the input to the function, and 'exp' represents the exponential function.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "1. **Bounded Output:** The output of the sigmoid function is always in the range (0, 1), making it useful for binary classification problems where the output represents the probability of a sample belonging to a particular class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Smoothness:** The sigmoid function is a smooth, differentiable function, which makes it suitable for gradient-based optimization algorithms used during the backpropagation process in neural network training.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages:**\n",
    "1. **Vanishing Gradient:** One of the most significant issues with the sigmoid activation function is the vanishing gradient problem. As the absolute value of the input 'x' becomes very large (positive or negative), the derivative of the sigmoid function approaches zero. During backpropagation, this leads to very small gradients, making it difficult for the network to update the weights effectively. Consequently, training deep networks with sigmoid activation functions becomes challenging, as the network struggles to learn and might suffer from slow convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Output Saturation:** The sigmoid function saturates (i.e., approaches 0 or 1) for extreme positive or negative inputs. This saturation causes the network to be less sensitive to changes in the input when the output is close to 0 or 1. It results in a limited learning capacity, making it harder for the model to capture complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Not Centered at Zero:** The sigmoid function is not centered at zero, leading to the output distribution being biased towards either 0 or 1. This can cause problems during gradient updates, as the biases might accumulate and create an uneven learning process.\n",

    "   - ReLU: The ReLU function maps negative input values to zero and leaves positive values unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Non-linearity:**\n",
    "   - Both sigmoid and ReLU are non-linear functions. The non-linear property is essential for neural networks to learn complex relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Activation for Negative Values:**\n",
    "   - Sigmoid: The sigmoid function smoothly maps negative input values to values close to zero but never exactly zero.\n",
    "   - ReLU: The ReLU function sets all negative input values to zero, effectively deactivating the corresponding neurons. This is what introduces sparsity in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Vanishing Gradient:**\n",
    "   - Sigmoid: The sigmoid function suffers from the vanishing gradient problem, especially when the input values are very large or very small. This can make training deep networks challenging.\n",
    "   - ReLU: The ReLU function doesn't suffer from the vanishing gradient problem for positive input values. However, it can lead to \"dead neurons\" when the neurons are deactivated and never recover (outputting zero) during training. Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU (PReLU) are variants introduced to address this issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Computational Efficiency:**\n",
    "   - ReLU is computationally more efficient compared to sigmoid and tanh since it involves a simple thresholding operation. Sigmoid and tanh require expensive exponentiation calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Centering Around Zero:**\n",
    "   - Sigmoid: The sigmoid function is centered around 0.5, meaning its average output is around 0.5 when the inputs are centered around zero.\n",
    "   - ReLU: The ReLU function is not centered around zero, and it outputs zero for all negative values. This can lead to biased activations and potentially unbalanced learning"

    "#### Using the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function over the sigmoid function offers several benefits, especially in the context of training deep neural networks. Here are the key advantages of ReLU:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Avoidance of Vanishing Gradient Problem:**\n",
    "   ReLU doesn't have this issue for positive inputs, as its gradient is always either 1 (for positive inputs) or 0 (for negative inputs).\n",

    "3. **Efficiency and Simplicity:**\n",
    "   It involves a simple thresholding operation, which makes it faster to compute compared to sigmoid and tanh functions, which require expensive exponentiation calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Sparse Activation:**\n",
    "   ReLU introduces sparsity in the network. When a neuron's output is set to zero for negative inputs, the corresponding neuron effectively becomes inactive, which leads to sparse activations. Sparse activations can help reduce memory and computational requirements during forward and backward passes in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Less Vanishing Gradient Bias:**\n",
    "   The sigmoid function is centered around 0.5, which can lead to a bias in the output distribution towards positive or negative values, depending on the data distribution. ReLU, being more sensitive to positive values, reduces this bias, resulting in more balanced learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Better Representation Learning:**\n",
    "   The absence of saturation in positive values allows ReLU neurons to be more informative, enabling the network to capture complex patterns in the data effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Scale-Invariance:**\n",
    "   ReLU is scale-invariant, meaning it doesn't change its behavior with respect to the magnitude of the input. This property can be beneficial for generalization and robustness."

    "The softmax function normalizes the input logits and converts them into probabilities that sum up to 1.

The formula for the softmax function for a vector of logits z of length K is as follows:\n",

    "    \n",
    "    2.Neural Network Output Layer: The softmax function is typically applied to the output layer of neural networks when dealing with multi-class classification problems. It converts the final layer's logits into probabilities, making it easier to interpret the model's predictions and choose the most likely class for a given input.\n",

The goal is to minimize this loss during training to improve the model's performance.\n",
